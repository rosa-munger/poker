Fresh off a win in the Red Dragon High Roller in Jeju just two weeks before, Zhou, looking sharp in an unusually bright white suit, conquered a field of 39 top-tier players in Event #2: $25,750 No-Limit Hold'em (7-Max). He walked away with his first PGT title, the coveted PGT Gold Cup, and a grand $316,000 prize – the eighth-biggest win of his career. The final table was intense, full of quick hands and big moves. It all came down to a fast-paced heads-up match between Zhou and the UK's Lewis Spencer. Spencer put up a good fight but, in the end, fell short, taking home a sizeable $220,000 in second place. Zhou's impressive run in this 10-day event affirmed his 10,000 buy-in win at the Monte Carlo $125K Event and a jaw-dropping $1,165,000. The $25,750 buy-in event, held at the luxurious Merit Royal Diamond Hotel & Spa, generated a prize pool of $965,500, shared among the top six players. Some other big names who made it to the final table were Ren Lin (3rd for $158,000), Benjamin Heath (4th for $116,500), Felipe Ketzer (5th for $83,000), and Jeremy Ausmus (6th for $62,000). Zhou's win moved him up to 198th on the PGT leaderboard with a total of 222 PGT points. Event #1 winner Roman Hrabec is close behind at Lewis Spencer's second place finish at 426 PGT Points. Ben Lin, Lewis Spencer, and Ren Lin also made a big leap to 42nd place with 773 PGT points.",

Felipe Ketzer – 890,000 7. Aram Zobian – 405,000 Final Table Recap Seven seasoned players returned on the final day, each with their eyes on the coveted PGT Gold Cup and the lion's share of the massive prize pool. The tension was palpable, with only six players destined to leave with a payday. The bubble burst early on and left the field. It was one of the longest bubbles in PGT history at these stakes. Finally, Aram Zobian's tournament life came to an end in seventh place when his queen-ten failed to hold up against Felipe Ketzer's jack-eight. With the bubble burst, the action didn't slow down. Ren Lin, fueled by aggression and a bit of luck, surged to the chip lead. Soon, Jeremy Ausmus, a seasoned pro with numerous titles to his name, moved all in with ace-queen. Unfortunately for him, Lin woke up with pocket tens. The board ran out clean for Lin, and Ausmus was eliminated in sixth place, leaving just five players remaining. The three-handed battle saw several dramatic hands. In a pivotal hand, Zhou flopped two pair, and Heath couldn't find any help on the turn or river. He was eliminated in fifth place. With four players remaining, the sole Brazilian on the table shoved from the big blind with three-deuce. Zhou, in the small blind, looked him up with king-eight. Unfortunately for Ketzer, his bottom pair fell short against Zhou's third pair, and he was eliminated in fifth place. With three players remaining, the action was fast and furious. Spencer scored a crucial double-up, his pocket kings holding up against Lin's pocket sixes when a queen spiked on the flop. But then, the overnight chip leader, Benjamin Heath, met his demise. He shoved with queen-jack, only to run into Zhou's ace-three. Zhou flopped two pair, and Heath couldn't find any help, and he was eliminated in fourth place. Heads-up play began with Lewis Spencer holding a slight chip lead with 3.92 Million chips to Quan Zhou's 3.87 Million. But in a dramatic turn of events, on just the second hand of heads-up, Spencer shoved with pocket sixes, and Zhou called with ace-deuce suited. The flop delivered an ace for Zhou. Spencer was in dire straits, needing to hit a six to stay alive. The turn and river brought no help, and just like that, it was over. Quan Zhou had done it again, adding another impressive victory to his rapidly growing resume. Complete Payouts (USD) 1. Quan Zhou – $316,000 2. Lewis Spencer – $220,000 3. Ren Lin – $158,000 4. Benjamin Heath – $116,500 5. Felipe Ketzer – $83,000 6. Jeremy Ausmus – $62,000"

As Quan Zhou becomes the global tournament ambassador for AA POKER, we wish him to continue his poker road in 2024, capturing more championship titles. Finally, if the Chinese were to establish a 'Poker Hall of Fame,' Quan Zhou would undoubtedly be a must-have inclusion!",

However, Wesley, who grew up on the other side of the globe, is different. He isn't bound by rules and regulations. Since entering the 'poker world' after making a name for himself in the cryptocurrency sphere, he has embraced a 'high-profile' approach—appearing on popular shows, engaging in high-stakes poker games, and indulging in various forms of 'flaunting wealth.' This unconventional style has naturally polarized public opinion. Some people said he was too ostentatious. However, as 2023 comes to a close, we seem to witness a true Wesley. He seems to be a warrior with an inherent sense of never giving up. On the American poker stage, he bravely showcases a different image of a Chinese poker player, contributing to a unique form of cultural export through his actions and words.",

        content: "Bryn Kenney, 36, is truly experiencing a stroke of good luck and double happiness this year. After becoming a sponsored player of AA POKER, he won the $250k Triton Poker London Luxon Invitational for $6.8 million.Until now, his career earnings reached over $65 million, overtaking Justin Bonomo on the All-Time Money List. After ascending to the top of the all-time money list at the age of 32, Bryn Kenney has predominantly maintained his position but sometimes stayed in second place for a short time.It is nearly impossible to articulate in any language the awe-inspiring performances on the tournament and money-making prowess of Bryn Kenney, who stands as the 'godlike figure' in this realm, 'a genius', and undoubtedly a future inductee into the 'Poker Hall of Fame'. How does he achieve such remarkable feats? Bryn Kenney (born November 1, 1986) is an American professional poker player from Long Island, New York. He is 36 years old, but some 80s or 90s players were surprised as he is such a young age.Kenney expressed remarkable memory skills from a very young age, possessing the gift of eidetic memory. As an infant, his mother Carol would show him baseball cards, and even before he could speak, he had memorized the names of at least 60 players.It is almost certain that this innate talent has helped Kenney become a professional poker. And his unique qualities have garnered unwavering support from his mother Carol, who always stands by him, allowing him the freedom to make his own choices and also becoming one of his fan. Kenney played SNS games with friends at first in high school, and his poker career also began. At the age of 17, unable to create his account due to being underage, his mother created an online account in her name for him. At 18, he officially opened his account, which he continues to use.From that on, poker completely consumed his life. A few weeks later, he dropped out of college to pursue a professional poker career, even though he had yet to prove himself as a valuable player. Fortunately, with unconditional support from his mother, his career quickly succeeded."

        content: "Securing his first gold bracelet is a turning point in Bryn Kenney's career, signaling the gears of destiny to set in motion. In 2014, at the age of 27, Bryn Kenney was already very famous both online and offline. This year was also very important for Kenney, as he not only participated in the WSOP but also gained his first gold bracelet, leaving an indelible mark on the world's largest poker tournament. The 2014 WSOP Event #63 was a $1,500 six-handed game, including 10 different poker games: Razz, 7-Triple-Draw Lowball, Omaha Hi-Lo, Pot-Limit Omaha, 7-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud High-Low Split, Pot-Limit Omaha, Omaha High-Low Split, Badugi, Limit Hold'ern, and No-Limit Hold'em. It's difficult for most players to understand the rules of these games, but for Kenney is very easy, which will also be thanks to his good memory. Kenney dominated Event #63 from the very beginning, bagging up the chip lead on Day 1. From there, Kenney continued to keep his seat at the top of the chip counts, remaining in the top ten chip counts throughout Day 2 and ultimately bagging second-place chips to end the day. With just four players left, Kenney led to a substantial chip lead early and rode that all of the way to his first championship bracelet.This victory earned Kenney his first career gold bracelet and a prize of $153,220. At that time, his total career earnings were $3.6 million, a far cry from his current staggering total of $65 million.However, in the remaining months of 2014, Kenney continued to participate in live poker tournaments, but his focus increasingly shifted toward high-roller and super high-roller events."

Zang won the title of Triton Million winner. However, due to Kenney's chip lead, he received the lion's share of the prize, £16,890,509 ($20,563,324), an unprecedented and possibly unparalleled sum.After this tournament, Bryn Kenney's career earnings reached $55,505,634, which is the first person to overtake Justin Bonomo to claim the top spot on the Hendon Mob all-time money list."

The heads-up battle began between Kenney and Talal Shakerchi, the winner of Triton Poker Vietnam, all of the chips got in the middle with Shakerchi holding ace-king and Kenney holding eight-nine. An eight-high flop gave Kenney a big lead and Shakerchi couldn't improve as he went out in second place.With this victory, Kenney had earned a prize of 6.86 million, bringing his total career earnings to $65.03 million, and once again has shot back up to the number one spot on the all-time money list, ahead of Justin Bonomo."

Moneymaker opened from under the gun with pocket jacks and his opponent Punsri moved in from the big blind after action folded all the way round. Moneymaker saw his opponent table KQ. Unfortunately, it was a fair fight until the dealer put a king on the flop and Moneymaker could not catch a two-outer to survive. At last, he got the fifth prize and $2.03 million.This fifth-place finish held extraordinary significance for Moneymaker. Firstly, it marked the second-highest prize of his professional career, second only to the $2.5 million he earned as the 2003 WSOP Main Event title. Secondly, it represented Moneymaker's debut in a high-stakes event with such a substantial buy-in, and his impressive performance was undoubtedly aided by the support of AA POKER, congratulating him on becoming their ambassador. He is the true architect of history, having changed and led it! He has genuinely embodied AA POKER's slogan: 'Anyone could be a star!'"

        content: "Born on November 21, 1975, Chris Moneymaker was 27 years old in 2003. At that time, he was an unknown accountant with an annual income of $40,000. His poker journey began with winning an $86 satellite tournament at the PokerStars online poker card room that awarded him a seat in the Main Event of the 2003 World Series of Poker. Advancing to the final four, Moneymaker contemplated intentionally losing the tournament. Because the top three could receive WSOP Main Event seats, while the fourth-place earned $8,000 in cash. At that time, he was fortunate to receive a call from a friend who encouraged him to seize the rare opportunity to play in the WSOP Main Event. His friend offered to contribute $5,000, covering half of Moneymaker's buy-in. But unfortunately, the promise wasn't fulfilled. Moneymaker felt regretful and annoyed, but at last Moneymaker's father and his other friend each contributed $2,000, covering 20% of his buy-ins and persuading him to proceed. So Moneymaker went to Las Vegas to participate in his first live tournament and won the championship. On Day 1, he ranked 11th. On Day 2, he ranked 26th (with 111 players remaining). On Day 3, he ranked 6th place (with 45 players remaining). It was on this day that he began to be captured attention in public after defeating Johnny Chan, a momentous achievement considering Chan's seven gold bracelets, two of which were WSOP Main Event titles. Moneymaker's mindset shifted as he progressed, firstly he just hoped for a modest prize, but later he realized he had a chance to earn much more. On Day4, Moneymaker dispatched the great Phil Ivey in a rollercoaster of a hand, where at one point Moneymaker looked certain to win, then lose, before yet another ace got him out of trouble, and sent Ivey packing. On Day 5, the FT between Moneymaker and Sam Farha who had already claimed a gold bracelet in $2,500 PLO lasted over 11 hours. When it was Moneymaker against Farha to decide the title, a monumentally brave bluff saw Moneymaker go all in, meaning he was essentially willing to bet his tournament life on nothing more than the high card of a king. Farha didn't just have the upper hand in every sense – a pair of nines – but knew it. The issue was that if his read of the situation was incorrect, Farha would have been eliminated and thus decided to fold. And so to that final hand. Moneymaker's five of diamonds and four of clubs were inferior compared to Farha's jack of hearts and 10 of diamonds, but another miracle took place when the flop of three community cards was revealed by the dealer. Not only did Moneymaker match his own cards with a five of spades and four of clubs to give him two pair, but Farha actually had top pair with the jack on the board, which made it appear he was in a better position. This time, Farha would go all in, which was an easy call for Moneymaker. The turn card produced an eight of diamonds, and the fifth and final river card was a five of hearts, to secure victory and give Moneymaker a full house in the process. That night, Moneymaker invited friends, poker players, and anyone willing to join him to celebrate his victory. The next day, he flew back home and hosted a party at the restaurant where he worked. In 2005, Moneymaker published his autobiography, continuing to participate in WSOP and EPT annually. He also enjoyed playing low-stakes poker games and supporting novice players."

DNegs made no secret of his support: 'The Grinder should have been in long ago! He is a legend, a living legend of the poker circle. He represents what poker should really be like! Enjoy the game, love the competition, don't have to be too serious, and still dominate the field. And he has been doing this for decades.'
