We may provide additional notice, such as an e-mail message or messaging within the Services, of any material changes. Unless we state otherwise, changes are effective when posted.

3. ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND SECURITY

In order to use our Services, we may ask you to create an Account and select a password and/or provide us with certain personal information, which may include your name, birth date, e-mail address, and, in some cases, payment information. This information will be held and used in accordance with AA POKER's Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account. Don't share your Account details with others or allow others to access or use your Account. We will treat all acts performed through your Account as being performed by you. You therefore accept responsibility for all acts done using your Account, whether or not authorized by you, including purchases made using any payment instrument (for example, credit card or PayPal), and you understand you may be held liable for losses incurred by us or any other user of the Services caused by someone else using your Account.

If you become aware of any actual or suspected loss, theft, fraud, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password, please tell us immediately.

4. USING OUR SERVICES

Who can use our Services

We are excited to have you start playing our games, but there are some limits on who can use our Services.

You may not use our Services if:
• You cannot enter into a binding contract with AA POKER.
• You are under 13 years of age (or under 16, if you are located in the European Economic Area (the "EEA")), in which case you must not create an Account, use any of our Services, or submit personal information in the Services or to AA POKER (for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address). This prohibition does not apply if, and only if, a AA POKER Service has an age-gate that collects age information before allowing a user to proceed and that age-gate allows users who identify themselves as under 13 years of age (or under 16 in the EEA) to use the Service. (As described in our Privacy Policy, in those instances, we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose personal information, except where and to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, including without limitation the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or obtain legally valid parental consent.)
• You are not allowed to receive products, including services or software, from the United States, for example if you are located in a country embargoed by the United States or if you are on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals.
• You are a convicted sex offender.
• You have previously been banned from playing any AA POKER game or using any AA POKER Service, unless AA POKER has reversed that ban, in its sole discretion.

If you are under the age of 18, or under the age of majority where you are located, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOUR LEGAL GUARDIAN HAS REVIEWED AND AGREED TO THESE TERMS.

Additional Important Rules and Terms

If you use our Services, you must follow the AA POKER Community Rules and all other Feature Terms that may apply. These additional rules and terms apply in addition to these Terms and are important. Please read them. If you access the Services from a social network, such as Facebook, or download the Services from Apple or Google, you must also comply with that third party's terms of service/use as well as these Terms.

Accessing our Services

To access or play our games or create an Account with us, you may need an account with a social network, like Facebook, and, if you are using our mobile Services, an account with the company that provides your mobile applications, like an Apple iTunes account. You may need to update third-party software from time to time to receive the Services and play AA POKER's Games.

We provide the games and other Services. You provide the equipment (phone, or tablet, etc.) and pay any fees to connect to the Internet and app stores, and for data or cellular usage to download and use the Services.

Service Changes and Limitations

Our Services are evolving and we may require that you accept updates to the Services as well as to the Terms, Community Rules, Feature Rules, and the AA POKER Privacy Policy. From time to time we may make you update the game or your software to continue to use our Services. We may perform these updates remotely, including to AA Poker software residing on your mobile device, without notifying you.

AA POKER reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or a particular game or part of the Services at any time either permanently or temporarily and without having to provide any reasons therefor, at which point your right to use the Services or any part of them will be automatically terminated or suspended. If that happens, unless applicable law requires otherwise, AA POKER is not required to provide refunds, benefits, or other compensation to you in connection with discontinued elements of the Services or for Virtual Items previously earned or purchased.

AA POKER MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, LIMIT, SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ACCOUNTS OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OR ANY PORTION OF THEM; PROHIBIT ACCESS TO OUR GAMES AND SITES, AND THEIR CONTENT, SERVICES, AND TOOLS; OR DELAY OR REMOVE HOSTED CONTENT, AND AA POKER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES OR RESULTS. This does not apply to users located in the EEA. If you are located in the EEA, we will endeavor to give you at least one month's notice of any material changes before they take effect, and if you are unhappy with those changes, you can choose to cancel your Services under these Terms.

Deleting your Account

You may stop using our Services at any time and may request that we delete your Account at any time by following the instructions in our Privacy Policy. Unless applicable law requires otherwise, we are not required to provide refunds, benefits, or other compensation if you request deletion of your Account.

Lawful Jurisdiction

You are solely responsible for knowing the lawful status of online gambling, or any other activity associated with our Services, that may be deemed to be unlawful in your country. For example: In Australia, the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (Cth) ("IGA") provides that prohibited interactive gambling services must not be provided to customers in Australia. Accordingly, unlicensed online casino gambling is illegal, and you may not use our Services as a "real world" money gambling means.

It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your country allows your use of our Services under its laws. We accept no responsibility or liability for any adverse action, or loss of any kind, that is associated with your unlawful utilisation of our Services within a disallowed jurisdiction. Should you engage in any unauthorised use of our Services such as by using it for "real-world" money gambling, you shall indemnify AA POKER against any liability arising from your unauthorised actions. AA POKER shall in that event be entitled to take any further action against you (including undertaking an investigation as per Section 6) for such unauthorised use of our Services, including the suspension or termination of your access to our Services.

5. OWNERSHIP; LIMITED LICENSE

Games and Services

The Services are comprised of works that are owned or licensed by AA POKER, and they are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, and other worldwide intellectual property rights and other applicable laws, rules, or regulations. All such rights are reserved. These Terms do not grant you or any other party any right, title, or interest in the Services or any content in the Services.

So long as you abide by these Terms and any other rules, including the Community Rules and any Feature Terms, you may use the Services subject to these Terms, for your own non-commercial, entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose and agree that AA POKER will have no liability to you for any damage or loss arising from unauthorized uses.

If you breach these Terms, or any of our other terms that apply to you, we may take action against you, up to and including terminating your account. In addition, you may be breaking the law, including breaches or violations of AA POKER's intellectual property rights. ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO DISRUPT OR INTERFERE WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDERMINING OR MANIPULATING THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF ANY AA POKER GAME, IS A BREACH OF AA POKER POLICY AND MAY BE A BREACH OR VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS.

Your Account and Virtual Items

Regardless of any other statement in these Terms, the Community Rules, or any Feature Terms that apply to features you may choose to use, you do not own any Account that you create on our Services, including in our games, and your Account is not your property. Likewise, you do not own any Virtual Items that you obtained through our Services, regardless of whether you "earned" those Virtual Items or "purchased" them. Your Account and any related Virtual Items are owned by AA POKER. AA POKER gives you a limited license and right to use your Account and the related Virtual Items while we offer the Services.

TO AVOID RETAINING DATA THAT IS NO LONGER NEEDED AND/OR TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES, WE MAY DELETE OR TERMINATE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE INACTIVE (I.E., NOT LOGGED INTO) FOR 180 DAYS.

You are not allowed to transfer Virtual Items outside of the Services (e.g., in the "real world"), for example by selling, gifting, or trading them. We won't recognize those transfers as legitimate. You are not allowed to sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for "real" money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and we may terminate your Account because of it.

In addition, if you are located in a jurisdiction where online gambling is unlawful, you may be in breach of that jurisdiction's gambling laws by using our Services to gamble and convert the Virtual Items of that gambling to "real world" money. This conduct is unlawful in Australia for example. Our Services have been solely designed for the use of users and clubs to engage in social gaming that does not involve the use of "real world" money. The Services are expressly not licensed to operate outside of a closed economy of Virtual Items. The Virtual Items used within our Services are in no way intended to be transferable, convertible, comparable, or used in place of "real world" money. We do not condone any secondary market between clubs and/or users that seeks to act as an intermediary for the conversion of our Virtual Items to "real world" money, in any fashion, directly, indirectly or otherwise, shall not be held responsible for any consequences arising from the operation of such secondary market.

User Content

If you post, publish, transmit, or upload User Content on the Services, you agree that it will be:
1. accurate;
2. not confidential;
3. not in violation of law;
4. not in violation of contractual restrictions or other parties' rights, and that you have permission to use the User Content from any other party whose personal or other information or intellectual property is contained within the User Content;
5. free of viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code;
6. in compliance with our Community Rules.

Your User Content will be processed by AA POKER in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your content.

Any User Content that you post, publish, or transmit will be considered non-proprietary and non-confidential. You retain all of your ownership rights in your User Content, but you give AA POKER a perpetual and irrevocable (other than as provided below or in our Privacy Policy), worldwide, royalty free, non-exclusive, license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Content and any modified and derivative works thereof in connection with the Services, including in marketing and promotions.

We have the right to remove any of your User Content if, in our opinion, it does not comply with these Terms, our Community Rules, or any applicable Feature Terms. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any of your User Content constitutes a breach of their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.

AA POKER's license to your User Content ends when you request deletion of your Account by submitting a request through our Personal Data Request Portal as described in our Privacy Policy, with the following exceptions:
1. User Content submitted in response to AA POKER promotions;
2. User Content either shared with others, which they have not deleted or already used publicly as allowed under these Terms; and
3. User Content subject to a separate license with AA POKER.

When you post, publish, or transmit your observations and comments on the Services, such as in forums, blogs, and chat features, we cannot guarantee that other players will not use the ideas and information that you share. If you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don't want others to use, don't post it. AA POKER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON'S USE OR APPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST, PUBLISH, OR TRANSMIT IN ANY FORUMS, BLOGS, OR CHAT ROOMS.

6. MONITORING USE OF SERVICES AND USER CONTENT

We are not responsible for information, materials, products, or services provided by other players (for instance, in their profiles) and User Content is not approved by us. However, if someone is violating these Terms or misusing the Services, please let us know by using the "Report Abuse" link provided in the Services or contacting us at Customer Support.

We have the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, record, or store your interactions with the Services or your communications with AA POKER or other player when you are using the Services (including without limitation your communications through in-game text or video chat). For more information, see our Privacy Policy.

Investigation

In jurisdictions where online gambling is deemed unlawful and we are of the reasonable belief that you may be engaging in "real world" money gambling, then we may investigate your use of our Services at our sole discretion and without prior notice to you.

An investigation may include, but will not be limited to the following actions:
1. monitoring and/or keeping record of the volume of transactions that pass through our Services;
2. monitoring and/or keeping record of known associates within any club that uses our Services;
3. requesting information, explanation, or detail about any observed conduct that we consider may be useful in ascertaining any club or user activity taken within our Services; and
4. referring any collected information to the appropriate authority where such investigation yields information or evidence that may reasonably indicate a breach of the gambling laws of that jurisdiction.

You agree to cooperate with any request, correspondence, show cause letter, or otherwise that may arise as a consequence of our investigation into your conduct. You shall additionally indemnify us from any and all direct, indirect, incidental and consequential loss or damage, resulting from your use of our Services.

7. YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER PLAYERS

You are responsible for your interactions with other players. If you have a problem with another player, we are not required to get involved, but we can if we desire.

If you have a dispute with another player, you release AA POKER, the AA POKER Corporate Family, and all AA POKER Affiliates from responsibility, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, resulting from that dispute or connected to that dispute.

We may allow you to use the Services to initiate SMS or MMS text messages to your friends, family, or other contacts. You are not required to send such text messages, you are solely responsible for them, and you understand that standard text messaging and data rates may apply based on your plan with your mobile phone carrier.

8. PAYMENT TERMS

We provide a service in the form of access to games, Virtual Items, and our other Services. In the Services you may use "real world" money to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.

How it Works

You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Apple or Google).

When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on platforms such as Apple or Google, AA POKER is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform's payment terms and conditions.

For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Service(s) or Virtual Item(s) that will be accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the limited license begins.

You understand that while you may "earn," "buy," or "purchase" Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent.

ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AA POKER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

Customer Support

For any customer assistance (i.e. technical issues, game play, or in-game purchasing questions), you may contact us through Customer Support.

9. PROMOTIONS AND OFFERS

From time to time, we may offer limited-time promotions. Please review the official rules or Feature Terms (if any) associated with any promotion. They will apply in addition to these Terms.

In addition, from time to time, we may promote Offers. We are not required to give, and you are not required to accept, any Offer. Offers are not transferable, redeemable, or exchangeable for other things of value, except at our sole discretion.

10. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING

Our Services may feature advertisements from us or other companies. Our Privacy Policy explains what information we share with advertisers. Please read it.

Sometimes we provide links in our games or on the Services to other third-party companies' websites or to companies who invite you to participate in a promotional offer. Any charge or obligation you take on in dealing with these other companies is your responsibility.

We are not responsible for any third-party website that we link to in our Services, and such a link does not mean we endorse or approve that linked site or any information you obtain from it.

Further, we do not in any way endorse "real world" money based third party advertisements. Any advertisement that either expressly or by implication, alludes to the use of "real world" money with our Services is prohibited.

11. COPYRIGHT NOTICES/COMPLAINTS

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do, as well. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), the E-Commerce Directive and associated legislation in the EU, and similar or equivalent other local laws that may apply.

12. FEEDBACK AND UNSOLICITED IDEAS

We may request your feedback on certain features through a promotion or our customer insights program. You are not obliged to respond to our request. Any feedback you provide at our request through a promotion or program is subject to the rules of the specific promotion or program.

13. AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES; WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

AA POKER, the AA POKER Corporate Family, and the AA POKER Affiliates make no promises or guarantees that the Services or any content on them will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free. We may suspend, withdraw, or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services for business and operational reasons.

USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THEY ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.

14. LIMITATIONS; WAIVER OF LIABILITY

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AA POKER, THE AA POKER CORPORATE FAMILY, AND THE AA POKER AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE
(1) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, NOR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES; OR
(2) FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF AA POKER, THE AA POKER CORPORATE FAMILY, AND/OR THE AA POKER AFFILIATES IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID AA POKER IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM.

15. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO PLAYERS IN THE US AND CANADA.

Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our Customer Support team at info@aapoker.app. In the event that you and AA POKER can't resolve the dispute through Customer Service, you and AA POKER both agree to arbitrate as described below.

You and AA POKER Both Agree to Arbitrate

By voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, AA Poker, and any member of the AA POKER Corporate Family all agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules, your relationship with us, or AA POKER's Services, through final and binding arbitration.

An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, AA Poker, and any member of the AA POKER Corporate Family all agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury.

The Arbitration Process

The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will control any arbitration between you and AA POKER or the AA POKER Corporate Family member, and AAA's then-current rules and procedures will be used. You can look at AAA's rules and procedures on their website at www.adr.org.

If you reside outside of the United States, arbitration may take place in the city where you reside at the time of filing. If you reside in the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of New York, United States of America.

If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing.

No Class Actions

By voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, AA Poker, and the AA POKER Corporate Family all agree that the parties can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.

That means:
1. The parties agree that neither you nor AA POKER nor any member of the AA POKER Corporate Family can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.
2. The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than one person's claim into a single case.
3. The parties agree that the arbitrator's decision or award in one person's case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other AA POKER players.

16. APPLICABLE LAW

If you are located in the United States, you agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 15. In addition, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by New York law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.

If you are located anywhere other than the United States, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by Hong Kong law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.

17. VENUE FOR LEGAL DISPUTES NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION

If you are located in the United States, judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 must be brought in state or federal court in Borough of Manhattan in New York City.

If you are located anywhere other than the United States, judicial proceedings must be brought in the courts of Ireland, unless the parties all agree to some other location.

18. SEPARATION OF TERMS

Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any part of these Terms, Feature Terms, or Community Rules is not enforceable, the rest of these Terms, Feature Terms, and Community Rules still apply and are binding.

19. ASSIGNMENT

We may give our rights, or our obligations, under these Terms, Feature Terms, or Community Rules to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not give your rights or your obligations under these Terms without first getting AA POKER's written consent.

20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

These Terms, and any other policies or rules we reference in these Terms, make up the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject matter of these Terms.

21. LANGUAGE OF THE TERMS

If we provide a translated version of these Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules, Privacy Policy, or any other terms or policy, it is for informational purposes only. If the translated version means something different from the English version, then the English meaning will be the one that applies.

22. NO WAIVER

If we do not enforce our rights under these Terms, Feature Terms, or Community Rules, that does not waive our right to do so later. If we do waive a default or breach by you, we will only do so in writing.

23. NOTICES

If we have to give you notice of something according to the Terms, Feature Terms, or Community Rules, we may notify you by posting a message on www.aapokerxxx.com or in the AA POKER game(s) you play, sending you an e-mail, or using other ways of communicating with you.

If you are located in the United States and you have to give us notice, the notice must be in writing and sent to info@aapoker.app, Attn: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

If you are located anywhere other than the United States, the notice must be in writing and sent to us through Customer Support.

24. FORCE MAJEURE

We are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control, for example changes or problems caused by natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.`,

Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks

We’ll collect some information from other companies, including social networks, if you access our games through your accounts with those companies or you choose to connect your accounts with those companies to our games.

If you play AA POKER’s games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, AA POKER may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the third-party application, your privacy settings, and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.

For example, AA POKER may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the connected third-party application:
• your first and last name;

If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.

Cookies and Other Automated Information Collection

We’ll collect information about your device and how you use our Services, including using cookies.

As further described in our Cookie Notice, we use cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs, and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different Services and devices. We also allow others to use cookies and similar technologies as described in our Cookie Notice. You can control or opt out of the use of cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for third-party advertising, as described in our Cookie Notice.

We, our service providers, and our business partners use these cookies and other similar technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information, including:
• IP address;
• the type of computer or mobile device you are using;
• platform type (like Apple iOS or Android);
• your operating system version;
• your mobile device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Apple Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or Android Advertising ID (AAID);
• application performance and de-bugging information;
• your browser type and language;
• referring and exit pages, and URLs;
• the number of clicks on an app feature or web page;
• the amount of time spent on an app feature or web page;
• domain names;
• landing pages;
• pages viewed and the order of those pages; and/or
• game state and the date and time of activity on our Services.

In some cases, we will connect the above information with your social network ID or AA POKER User ID.

If you play AA POKER games on a mobile device, in addition to your device identifiers (described above), we may also collect:
• the name you have associated with your device;
• your country;

• your specific geolocation (with your permission); and/or

Other Sources

We may collect information from other third-party sources. Where we do, we’ll let you know.

We may collect or receive information about you from other sources like third-party information providers. We use this information along with information you provide us directly, for example, to help you and your friends connect or to serve you advertising more tailored to your interests.

3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING IT

We use your information to provide, personalize, maintain the security of, and improve the Services you use; to maintain our business operations; and to exercise, defend or establish our rights.

We use your information under several legal bases, including to perform our contract with you, for our legitimate business interests, to comply with our legal obligations, or otherwise with your consent.

The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide you with the Services you request from us and to improve your gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:
• to improve and optimize our Services and our players’ experiences;
• to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;
• to identify and suggest connections with other AA POKER players and personalize our Services to you;
• to communicate with you about the Services you’re using, including in-game updates, new Services, and promotional offers that we think might be of interest to you;
• to enable players to communicate with each other;
• to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;
• to protect the safety and well-being of our players;
• to protect AA POKER’s rights and property in connection with our Services;
• to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service;
• to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;
• to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;
• to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and/or
• to conduct research.

If you are located in the European Countries (defined above in Section 1), our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it.

However, we’ll normally collect information from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service), where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights), or if we otherwise have your consent.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another player).

If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory.

Similarly, if we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and marketing, for example).

If you have questions or need further information about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal information, please Contact Us.

4. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

We’ll share your information with third parties when you use our Services under the circumstances described in this subsection.

We’ll share some of your information with your friends and other AA Poker players that you’re playing with to facilitate your gaming interactions with them.

We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties or allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the following circumstances:

Friends and Other AA POKER Players

AA POKER’s games and Services support and often encourage you to interact with other players. In many AA POKER games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends, will be able to see your player profile (as described above); view descriptions of your in-game activity; and communicate with you within our Services. For example, in AA POKER Poker, when you are playing at a table, all the other players at the same table can see your player profile and send you an in-game chat message.

Third-Party Advertising Including Behavioral Advertising and Analytics

We’ll share some of your information with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your interests and to enable us to offer some of our Services for free.

We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games, game features, and other Services for free. These advertisements may include, without limitation, banner ads on game boards or Services themselves, as full-screen ads between moves or games, or through an “offer wall” in which third-party advertisers offer to provide virtual currency or other in-game items to players in exchange for watching an advertisement or for completing a task, such as signing up for an account with one of the advertisers, completing a survey, or finishing a particular game level. Offer walls are hosted by third-party offer wall providers, and the offers are made by third-party advertisers, not by AA POKER.

We do not actively share personal information that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.

To enable advertisers, ad networks, and offer wall providers to serve you with more relevant ads, they may collect, or we may collect and share with them, the following types of information when you use our Services:
• performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
• certain technical information (like IP address, non-persistent device identifier such as IDFA, and de-identified persistent device identifier such as a hashed Android ID);
• a unique identifier, such as your social network ID or AA POKER player ID; and/or
• other contextual data about your game play (like your level and session length).

In addition to serving you with relevant ads, the information collected may be used to:
• measure how effective ads are;
• offer you targeted advertising (both on and off our Services) in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising); and/or
• undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience.

Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.

Please note, after clicking on a third-party advertisement or offer, you may no longer be on a site or app controlled by AA POKER or the social network through which you are playing AA POKER’s games.

For more information on controlling the use of cookies and similar technologies, please see our Cookie Notice. Please note that the practices of third-party companies delivering advertisements on our Services are subject to those companies’ own privacy policies.

Safety, Security, and Compliance with Law

We’ll share your information if necessary for safety, security, or compliance with law.

Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between you and AA POKER may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:
• to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply;
• when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for national security, law enforcement, or legal process purposes (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
• when we believe in our sole discretion that our Services are being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions;
• when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person, or the public generally; and/or
• to protect the rights or property of AA POKER or applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service.

Third-Party Service Providers

We’ll share your information with the third-party service providers and business partners that we work with to bring you our Services.

We will share your information with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, analytics, analysis, hosting services, customer service, marketing, and advertising optimization. We will also share your information with our third-party business partners who assist us in delivering and optimizing our Services, such as our platform partners (Apple or Google, etc.). Where we share your information with third-party service providers and business partners, we ensure that we have appropriate agreements in place to protect your information (as required by applicable data protection laws).

Sale or Merger

We’ll share your information with the interested party if we undergo or evaluate undergoing a sale or merger.

In the event that AA POKER undergoes or evaluates undergoing a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts to let you and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition before transferring your personal information.

Other Third Parties

We may share some of your information with other third parties if we have your consent to do so.

In addition to the sharing described above, we may share your information with other third parties or allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy if we have your consent to do so.

Group Marketing

We may use your name, email address and phone number for the purpose of providing you with news, promotions and other marketing offers from our group of companies, Affiliated Entities, our agents and third parties providing services to us or to you on our behalf. If you no longer wish to receive these promotional communications, newsletters and marketing offers, you may opt-out of receiving them either when you register with us initially, or subsequently by following the 'opt-out' instructions included in each communication. You are also entitled at any time to notify us that you do not wish to receive any promotional communications from us and you may do this by emailing us at info@aapoker.app.

5. YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

European Countries’ Users’ Rights

If you’re a user located in the European Countries, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information.

If you are located in the European Countries (defined above in Section 1), you have the following data protection rights:
• You can access or request deletion of your personal information by submitting a request through our Personal Data Request Portal.
• You can correct or update your personal information, object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.
• You can opt-out of marketing communications we send you by following the instructions in “Opting Out of Promotional Communications from AA POKER” below.
• If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
• You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority (Contact details are available here.)

To exercise your rights to access or deletion, please submit a request through our Personal Data Request Portal. If you have any problems with the Portal or would like to exercise any of your other rights, you can Contact Us. We respond to all data protection requests we receive in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Accessing and Deleting Personal Information Held by AA POKER

You can request a copy of or deletion of your game account data through our Personal Data Request Portal.

To review and update personal information associated with your AA Poker player profile in certain games, visit the “settings” page in that game.

If you want to review or delete personal information associated with your game account data, please submit a request through our Personal Data Request Portal. If you have any problems with the Portal, please Contact Us.

For deletion requests, we will take reasonable measures to delete your personal information from our records. If you have sent content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete it. We will keep certain records (e.g., personal information relating to payments or customer service matters) where we need (and have rights) to, such as for legal or accounting purposes. We’ll also keep information in order to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.

Managing Personal Information We Receive From Third-Party Applications / Platforms And From Your Mobile Device

To manage the information we receive from third-party applications or platforms and from your mobile device, use the tools and settings provided by the third-party application and your mobile device.

To manage the information AA POKER receives about you from a third-party application or platform where you play our games, like Facebook, Apple, Google, you will need to follow the third-party application’s instructions for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.

You also can manage many aspects of information collection and use from your mobile device by visiting the “settings” page of your mobile device and reviewing the access permissions of each AA POKER game / application.

Once AA POKER receives your information from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by AA POKER in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described above.

Opting Out of Promotional Communications from AA POKER

You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device’s settings page.

If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn off push notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page. Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “settings” page.

Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the Services you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.

Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising

You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.

If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile web advertising from third parties, you may visit the following websites:
• Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising; and
• Your Online Choices website for EU-based advertising.

If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”). You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.

All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by AA POKER. AA POKER does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.

Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in AA POKER’s Services after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.

6. PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND ADVERTISERS

We aren’t responsible for the ways in which third parties use your information (other than our service providers acting under our instructions).

Our websites and games may contain advertisements from “Third-Party Services,” meaning companies other than AA POKER, that may link to their own websites, online services, or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Third-Party Services. If you have any questions about how these Third-Party Services use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.

7. OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN

We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children.

Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Countries) (collectively, “Children”). Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children.

Though our Services do not target Children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain Services. For users who identify themselves as Children in our age-gate on such Services, if we allow Children to use the Services, we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose “personal information” (as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)), except as permitted by COPPA, or obtain legally valid parental consent.

If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.

8. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRANSFERS OUT OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries. When we transfer, store, and use personal information collected in the European Countries outside of the European Countries, we comply with our legal obligations and ensure that your personal information is subject to suitable safeguards or transferred to “approved” territories.

IMPORTANT: When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.

As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our “Affiliated Entities,” which are any other corporate entities under common ownership with AA POKER, or to our business partners and service providers from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.

Personal information collected in the European Countries may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Countries. The data we hold may also be processed by employees operating outside of the European Countries who work for us, one of our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business partners or service providers. This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details, or (ii) the provision of support services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.

Participating European countries’ residents should direct any questions, concerns or complaints regarding AA POKER’s handling of personal information or compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to AA POKER at:
info@aapoker.app

9. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION

We’ll keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, maintain our legitimate business operations, and/or exercise, defend or establish our rights.

How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.

We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after you have closed, or we have deleted, your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.

10. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We work hard to protect your information but you also have a role to play.

We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline and to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.

If you have an account registered directly with AA POKER, your profile information is protected by the password you use to access your AA POKER account. It is important that you protect and maintain your AA POKER account’s security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your AA POKER account, the Services allow you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your AA POKER game accounts without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your AA POKER account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.

When you sign into your AA POKER account or enter payment information, we and our third-party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.

While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please Contact Us.

11. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We’ll let you know about any material changes to this Privacy Policy.

If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game or on www.aapokerxxx.com, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law). We may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or player forums. You should periodically check www.aapokerxxx.com and this Privacy Policy for updates.

12. CONTACT US

You can contact us with your questions, comments, or concerns.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy and/or privacy practices, please send an e-mail to info@aapoker.app. For all other matters, please contact AA POKER through info@aapoker.app.`

其他重要規則和條款

如果您使用我們的服務，您必須遵守 AA POKER 社區規則和所有其他可能適用的功能條款。這些附加規則和條款適用於這些條款，並且很重要。請閱讀它們。如果您從 Facebook 等社交網路訪問服務，或從 Apple 或 Google 下載服務，您還必須遵守該第三方的服務/使用條款以及這些條款。

訪問我們的服務

要訪問或玩我們的遊戲或在我們這裏創建帳戶，您可能需要一個社交網路帳戶，例如 Facebook，如果您使用我們的移動服務，還需要一個提供您的移動應用程式的公司的帳戶，例如 Apple iTunes 帳戶。您可能需要不時更新第三方軟體以接收服務和玩 AA Poker 的遊戲。我們提供遊戲和其他服務。您提供設備（手機或平板電腦等）並支付任何費用以連接到 Internet 和應用程式商店，以及下載和使用服務的數據或蜂窩使用。

服務變更和限制

我們的服務不斷發展，我們可能會要求您接受對服務以及條款、社區規則、功能規則和 AA POKER 隱私政策的更新。我們可能會不時讓您更新遊戲或您的軟體以繼續使用我們的服務。我們可能會在不通知您的情況下遠程執行這些更新，包括對您移動設備上的 AA POKER 軟體進行更新。AA POKER 保留隨時永久或暫時停止提供和/或支持服務或特定遊戲或部分服務的權利，無需為此提供任何理由，此時您有權使用服務或任何部分其中的一部分將自動終止或暫停。如果發生這種情況，除非適用法律另有要求，否則 AA POKER 無需就已終止的服務元素或之前賺取或購買的虛擬物品向您提供退款、利益或其他補償。AA POKER 可自行決定限制、暫停、終止、修改或刪除帳戶或對服務或其任何部分的訪問；禁止訪問我們的遊戲和網站及其內容、服務和工具；或延遲或刪除託管內容，AA POKER 沒有義務對您的任何損失或結果進行賠償。這不適用於位於 EEA 的用戶。如果您位於歐洲經濟區，我們將努力在任何重大變更生效前至少提前一個月通知您，如果您對這些變更不滿意，您可以選擇根據這些條款取消您的服務。

刪除您的帳戶

您可以隨時停止使用我們的服務，並可以按照我們隱私政策中的說明隨時要求我們刪除您的帳戶。除非適用法律另有要求，否則如果您要求刪除您的帳戶，我們無需提供退款、福利或其他補償。

合法管轄權

您全權負責瞭解線上賭博或與我們的服務相關的任何其他活動的合法狀態，這些活動在您所在的國家/地區可能被視為非法。例如：在澳大利亞，《2001 年互動賭博法》（聯邦）（"IGA"）規定不得向澳大利亞客戶提供被禁止的互動賭博服務。因此，未經許可的線上賭場賭博是非法的，您不得將我們的服務用作"現實世界"的金錢賭博手段。您有責任確保您所在的國家/地區根據其法律允許您使用我們的服務。對於與您在不允許的司法管轄區內非法使用我們的服務相關的任何不利行為或任何類型的損失，我們不承擔任何責任或義務。如果您未經授權使用我們的服務，例如將其用於"真實世界"的金錢賭博，您應賠償 AA POKER 因您未經授權的行為而產生的任何責任。在這種情況下，AA POKER 有權就您未經授權使用我們的服務對您採取任何進一步的行動（包括根據第 6 條進行調查），包括暫停或終止您對我們服務的訪問。

5. 所有權；有限許可

遊戲和服務

服務由 AA POKER 擁有或許可的作品組成，它們受版權、商標、商業外觀、專利和其他全球知識產權以及其他適用法律、規則或條例的保護。所有類似許可權一律保留。這些條款不授予您或任何其他方對服務或服務中的任何內容的任何權利、所有權或利益。只要您遵守這些條款和任何其他規則，包括社區規則和任何功能條款，您就可以使用受這些條款約束的服務，用於您自己的非商業娛樂目的。您同意不將服務用於任何其他目的，並同意 AA POKER 對您因未經授權的使用而造成的任何損害或損失不承擔任何責任。如果您違反這些條款或我們適用於您的任何其他條款，我們可能會對您採取行動，包括終止您的帳戶。此外，您可能會觸犯法律，包括違反或侵犯 AA POKER 的知識產權。您試圖破壞或干擾服務，包括但不限於破壞或操縱任何 AA POKER 遊戲的合法運營，均違反 AA POKER 政策，並可能違反或違反刑法和民法。

您的帳戶和虛擬物品

無論這些條款、社區規則或適用於您可能選擇使用的功能的任何功能條款中的任何其他聲明如何，您不擁有您在我們的服務（包括在我們的遊戲中）上創建的任何帳戶，並且您的帳戶不你的財產。同樣，您不擁有通過我們的服務獲得的任何虛擬物品，無論您是"賺取"或"購買"這些虛擬物品。您的帳戶和任何相關虛擬物品均歸 AA POKER 所有。AA POKER 授予您在我們提供服務期間使用您的帳戶和相關虛擬物品的有限許可和權利。為避免保留不再需要的數據和/或改進我們的服務，我們可能會刪除或終止 180 天內不活動（即未登錄）的帳戶。您不得在服務之外（例如，在"現實世界"）轉讓虛擬物品，例如通過出售、贈送或交易它們。我們不會承認這些轉移是合法的。您不得再許可、交易、出售或試圖出售虛擬物品以獲取"真實"貨幣，或將虛擬物品交換為遊戲以外的任何類型的價值。任何此類轉移或嘗試轉移都是被禁止和無效的，我們可能因此終止您的帳戶。此外，如果您所在的司法管轄區禁止線上賭博，您可能會違反該司法管轄區的賭博法，因為您使用我們的服務進行賭博並將該賭博的虛擬物品轉換為"現實世界"的金錢。例如，這種行為在澳大利亞是非法的。我們的服務專為用戶和俱樂部的使用而設計，以參與不涉及使用"現實世界"金錢的社交遊戲。服務明確未獲得在封閉的虛擬物品經濟之外運營的許可。我們服務中使用的虛擬物品絕不旨在可轉讓、可兌換、可比較或用於代替"現實世界"貨幣。我們不容忍俱樂部和/或用戶之間的任何二級市場試圖充當將我們的虛擬物品轉換為"現實世界"貨幣的仲介，

用戶內容

如果您在服務上發佈、發佈、傳輸或上傳用戶內容，即表示您同意：1. 準確；2. 不保密；3. 不違反法律；4. 不違反合同限制或其他方的權利，並且您有權使用用戶內容中包含其個人或其他資訊或知識產權的任何其他方的用戶內容；5. 沒有病毒、廣告軟體、間諜軟體、蠕蟲或其他惡意代碼；6. 遵守我們的社區規則。AA POKER 將根據我們的隱私政策處理您的用戶內容。您全權負責保護和備份您的內容。您發佈、發佈或傳輸的任何用戶內容將被視為非專有和非機密。您保留對您的用戶內容的所有所有權，但您授予 AA POKER 永久且不可撤銷（下文或我們的隱私政策中規定的除外）、全球範圍內、免版稅、非排他性的許可，以使用、複製、分發、準備、展示和執行您的用戶內容的衍生作品及其與服務相關的任何修改和衍生作品，包括行銷和促銷。在適用法律允許的範圍內，您放棄您在任何用戶內容中可能擁有的任何道德權利（例如被識別為用戶內容作者的權利或反對對該用戶內容進行特定使用的權利）。如果我們認為您的任何用戶內容不符合這些條款、我們的社區規則或任何適用的功能條款，我們有權刪除它。我們還有權向任何聲稱您的任何用戶內容構成侵犯其知識產權或隱私權的第三方披露您的身份。我們還會在法律要求的情況下向其他第三方或政府機構披露您的用戶內容。當您通過我們的隱私政策中所述的個人數據請求門戶提交請求來請求刪除您的帳戶時，AA Poker 對您的用戶內容的許可將終止，但以下情況除外：1. 為回應 AA POKER 促銷而提交的用戶內容，將受任何功能條款或促銷的其他條款的約束；2. 與他人分享但未被刪除或已在本條款允許範圍內公開使用的用戶內容；和3. 用戶內容受 AA POKER 單獨許可的約束，AA POKER 將受此類許可條款的約束。如果您請求刪除您的用戶內容，我們將採取合理的步驟來停止您的用戶內容的使用，其中可能包括在我們的系統中禁止您的用戶內容。但是，用戶內容可能會保留在我們的系統中，包括備份副本。如果我們有理由相信法律要求，我們也可能會保留用戶內容的副本。當您在論壇、博客和聊天功能等服務中發佈、發佈或傳輸您的意見和評論時，我們無法保證其他玩家不會使用您分享的想法和資訊。如果您有想要保密和/或不想讓其他人使用的想法或資訊，請不要張貼。AA POKER 不對任何其他人使用或盜用您在任何論壇、博客或聊天室中發佈、發佈或傳輸的任何內容或資訊負責。

6. 監控服務和用戶內容的使用

我們不對其他玩家（例如，在他們的個人資料中）提供的資訊、材料、產品或服務負責，並且用戶內容未經我們批准。但是，如果有人違反這些條款或濫用服務，請使用服務中提供的"報告濫用"鏈接或通過客戶支持聯繫我們來告知我們。我們有權自行決定監控、記錄或存儲您與服務的互動或您在使用服務時與 AA Poker 或其他玩家的通信（包括但不限於您通過遊戲內文本或視頻聊天進行的通信）。有關更多資訊，請參閱我們的隱私政策。我們也可以自行決定選擇編輯、拒絕發佈或刪除任何用戶內容。如果我們確定您的通信或用戶內容違反了這些條款、功能條款或社區規則，我們有權自行決定且恕不另行通知，禁止您發佈用戶內容或與其他玩家通信，或者我們可能會完全終止您對服務的訪問。

調查

在線上賭博被視為非法的司法管轄區，我們有理由相信您可能參與"現實世界"的金錢賭博，那麼我們可能會自行決定調查您對我們服務的使用情況，恕不另行通知。調查可能包括但不限於以下行動；1. 監控和/或記錄通過我們服務的交易量；2. 監控和/或記錄任何使用我們服務的俱樂部內的已知員工；3. 要求提供我們認為可能有助於確定我們服務中的任何俱樂部或用戶活動的任何觀察到的行為的資訊、解釋或詳細資訊；和4. 將任何收集到的資訊提交給適當的機構，如果此類調查產生的資訊或證據可能合理地表明違反了該司法管轄區的賭博法。例如，在澳大利亞，資訊可能會傳遞給澳大利亞通信和媒體管理局（"ACMA"）、澳大利亞交易報告和分析中心（"AUSTRAC"）或其他相關機構。您同意配合任何請求、信件、說明原因信或因我們對您的行為進行調查而可能出現的其他情況。對於因您使用我們的服務而導致的任何和所有直接、間接、附帶和後果性損失或損害，您還應賠償我們。如果您不遵守本協議的任何要求或條款，我們保留暫停您訪問我們服務的權利，直到我們收到您的滿意答復。或者，如果我們認為任何行動、行為或其他行為違反了這些條款或任何管轄此類行動或行為的法規，我們保留自行決定立即終止您訪問我們服務的權利，恕不另行通知通知你。如果我們收到任何一方在我們的服務中使用"真實世界"貨幣的投訴，我們保留自行決定對該投訴採取行動的權利，包括終止或暫停任何據稱或懷疑與"真實世界"相關的帳戶世界"金錢賭博。您同意，如果第三方執法機構提出要求和/或我們認為有必要或希望這樣做，我們可以向第三方執法機構提供從任何調查中獲得的結果或相關證據。

7. 您與其他玩家的交易

您對與其他玩家的互動負責。如果您與其他玩家有問題，我們不需要介入，但如果我們願意，我們可以介入。如果您與其他玩家發生糾紛，您免除 AA POKER、AA POKER 公司家族和所有 AA POKER 附屬公司的責任、索賠、要求和/或各種類型和性質的（實際的或間接的）損害，無論是已知的還是未知的，由此導致的來自該爭議或與該爭議有關。這包括利潤損失、商譽損失、使用損失或數據損失。這不適用於位於 EEA 的用戶。如果您位於歐洲經濟區，則您對 AA POKER 的責任由您所在國家/地區適用的法律規定。如果您位於加利福尼亞州，則您放棄加利福尼亞州民法典第 1542 條，其中規定："一般免責聲明不適用於債權人在執行免責聲明時不知道或懷疑存在對他或她有利的索賠，如果他或她知道，這一定會對他與債務人的和解產生重大影響。"我們可能允許您使用服務向您的朋友、家人或其他聯繫人發送短信或彩信短信。您無需發送此類短信，您全權負責，並且您瞭解標準短信和數據費率可能適用，具體取決於您與移動電話運營商的計畫。您還瞭解，AA Poker 不控制這些短信的收件人、內容或發送時間。如果您選擇通過服務發送短信，即表示您向我們聲明並保證短信的收件人已適當同意接收短信。如果與其他玩家的交易導致投訴、通知或其他涉及使用或涉嫌使用"現實世界"金錢的行為，我們保留就以下行為採取任何進一步行動（包括根據第 6 節進行調查）的權利此類投訴或通知。

8. 付款條件

10. 第三方廣告

我們的服務可能包含來自我們或其他公司的廣告。我們的隱私政策解釋了我們與廣告商共用的資訊。請閱讀。有時，我們會在我們的遊戲或服務中提供指向其他第三方公司網站或邀請您參與促銷活動並向您提供某些服務功能或升級（例如遊戲內貨幣）的公司的鏈接交換。您在與這些其他公司打交道時承擔的任何費用或義務均由您負責。我們不對我們在服務中鏈接到的任何第三方網站負責，此類鏈接並不意味著我們認可或批准該鏈接網站或您從中獲得的任何資訊。對於與第三方的任何內容、商品和/或服務有關的任何索賠，我們概不負責。另請注意，鏈接的第三方網站不受我們的控制，可能會收集數據或要求您向他們提供個人或其他資訊，或者他們可能會自動收集您的資訊。當您使用這些第三方網站和服務時，第三方公司可能（也可能不會）請求您允許訪問您的資訊和內容。我們不對這些其他公司的內容、商業慣例或隱私政策負責，也不對他們如何收集、使用或共用從您那裏獲得的資訊負責。此外，我們不以任何方式認可基於"真實世界"金錢的第三方廣告。禁止任何明示或暗示暗示在我們的服務中使用"現實世界"金錢的廣告。我們絕不會認可或同意第三方使用我們的服務進行"現實世界"金錢廣告，我們不與任何可能被發現在宣傳"現實世界"金錢賭博的第三方有任何關聯，也不承擔任何責任，這些第三方提及、命名、或展示我們的服務、網站或我們的任何相關知識產權。如果您參與我們服務的任何違禁廣告，我們保留立即終止您的帳戶的權利，恕不另行通知。此外，如果認為有必要，我們還可能會向您發送一封終止信。根據法律和這些條款，我們保留我們的權利，以向您收回與任何此類停止和終止通知的費用相關的所有款項。您同意賠償我們此類費用以及與刪除這些條款或法律禁止的廣告相關的任何其他合理費用，或與此類事項相關的任何費用。

11. 版權聲明/投訴

我們尊重他人的知識產權，並要求您也這樣做。我們會根據美國數字千年版權法（"DMCA"）、歐盟的電子商務指令和相關立法以及可能適用的類似或等效的其他當地法律對涉嫌侵犯版權的通知作出回應。如需更多資訊，請前往 AA POKER 的版權頁面查看我們的通知指南。如果我們確定玩家是"屢次侵權者"，我們保留終止任何玩家訪問服務的權利。我們不必在執行此操作之前通知玩家。

13. 服務的可用性；免責聲明

AA POKER、AA POKER Corporate Family 和 AA POKER Affiliates 不承諾或保證服務或其中的任何內容始終可用、不間斷或無錯誤。出於業務和運營原因，我們可能會暫停、撤銷或限制我們服務的全部或任何部分的可用性。使用服務的風險由您自行承擔。它們按"原樣"提供。在適用法律允許的範圍內，AA POKER、AA POKER 集團公司和 AA POKER 附屬公司不對服務作出任何明示或暗示的保證、條件或其他任何類型的條款。AA POKER、AA POKER 公司家族和 AA POKER 附屬公司不提供任何所有權保證或默示保證、條件或其他非侵權、適銷性、安靜享受或適用於特定用途的條款。如果您所在的州或國家/地區不允許這些免責聲明，則它們不適用於您。如果您所在的州或國家/地區要求適用保修的特定期限，則該期限為您首次使用服務後的 30 天或法律要求的最短期限，以較短者為准。

14. 限制；免責聲明

您承認 AA POKER、AA POKER 集團和 AA POKER 附屬公司不承擔任何責任(1) 對於任何間接的、偶然的、特殊的、懲戒性的或後果性的損害，或任何利潤、商譽或數據的損失，以任何方式因使用或無法使用服務而引起；或者(2) 對於第三方的行為，包括服務的其他用戶和外部網站的運營商。使用服務和外部網站的風險完全由您承擔，服務和外部網站造成傷害的風險也由您承擔。在適用的任何法律允許的最大範圍內，這些條款中的免責聲明適用於因服務造成的或與使用或無法使用服務相關的所有損害或傷害，在任何訴訟因由下管轄權，包括但不限於針對違反保證、違反合同或侵權行為（包括疏忽）採取的行動。在適用法律允許的最大範圍內，AA POKER、AA POKER 集團公司和/或 AA POKER 附屬公司的全部責任僅限於您已向 AA POKER、AA POKER 集團公司和/或 AA POKER 附屬公司支付的總金額在您首次提出任何此類索賠之日之前一百八十 (180) 天。如果您在您首次提出任何此類索賠之日之前的一百八十 (180) 天內未向 AA POKER、AA POKER 公司家族或任何 AA POKER 關聯公司支付任何款項，則您對任何爭議的唯一和排他性補救措施對於 AA POKER，AA POKER 公司家族和/或任何 AA POKER 附屬公司將停止使用服務並註銷您的帳戶。某些州或國家不允許排除某些保證或上述責任限制/排除，這意味著如果您居住在這些州或國家之一，則這些限制/排除可能不適用於您。這些限制/排除完全適用於新澤西州居民。這些限制/排除不適用於位於 EEA 的用戶。對於這些用戶，如果 AA POKER 未能遵守這些條款，AA POKER 將對您因 AA POKER 違反這些條款或因 AA Poker 的疏忽而遭受的可預見的損失或損害負責，但 AA POKER 不對任何損失或損害負責。不可預見的損害。如果損失或損害是我們違約的明顯後果，或者如果您和 AA POKER 在我們訂立這些條款時已考慮到，則損失或損害是可預見的。

15. 仲裁協議和集體訴訟豁免

本節僅適用於美國和加拿大的玩家。在提起正式法律訴訟之前，您必須先通過 info@aapoker.app 聯繫我們的客戶支持團隊。如果您和 AA POKER 無法通過客戶服務解決爭議，您和 AA POKER 均同意按如下所述進行仲裁。

您和AA Poker均同意仲裁

通過自願接受這些條款（以及在我們的許多服務中，通過自願點擊或點擊遊戲內按鈕以明確表示您同意這些條款），您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER Corporate Family 的任何成員都同意解決任何索賠關於條款、功能條款、社區規則、您與我們的關係或 AA POKER 的服務，通過最終和有約束力的仲裁。這適用於任何法律理論下的所有索賠，除非索賠符合下文確定的仲裁協議例外情況。即使您停止使用您的 AA POKER 帳戶或將其刪除，此仲裁協議也同樣適用。（在本第 15 條和第 17 條中，您、AA POKER 和 AA POKER 公司家族的任何成員可單獨稱為"一方"或統稱為"各方"。）仲裁程式是在中立的仲裁員而不是法官和陪審團之前進行的，因此通過自願接受這些條款，您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER 公司家族的任何成員都同意放棄在法官和陪審團面前進行審判的權利。仲裁與法庭訴訟有不同的規則。它們不像法庭訴訟那樣正式，並且提供有限的機會來迫使另一方分享與爭議相關的資訊——這一過程稱為發現。仲裁員可以在個人基礎上判給與法院判給個人相同的損害賠償和救濟。但是，如果任何一方不喜歡仲裁員的決定，法院改變仲裁結果或讓仲裁員重新考慮其決定的能力有限。如果任何一方對本仲裁協議是否可以執行或是否適用於爭議有不同意見，各方均同意仲裁員也將作出決定。此外，如果您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企業家族成員向法院提起應仲裁的索賠，或任何一方拒絕仲裁應仲裁的索賠，任何其他方都可以請求法院強制當事人去仲裁提交仲裁以解決索賠（即強制仲裁）。在仲裁程式進行期間，您、AA Poker 或 AA POKER 公司家族成員也可以要求法院停止訴訟程式（即中止法院訴訟程式）。

仲裁程式

美國仲裁協會（"AAA"）將控制您與 AA POKER 或 AA POKER 公司家族成員之間的任何仲裁，並且將使用 AAA 當時有效的規則和程式，包括消費者相關爭議的補充程式。您可以在其網站 www.adr.org 上查看 AAA 的規則和程式。如果這些條款中的某些內容與 AAA 的規則和程式不同，則雙方同意遵守這些條款。要啟動仲裁程式，請使用 AAA 網站 (www.adr.org) 上的表格。如果您居住在美國境外，仲裁可能會在您提交申請時居住的城市進行。如果您居住在美國，仲裁應在美利堅合眾國紐約州啟動。您和 AA POKER 進一步同意服從紐約市曼哈頓區任何聯邦或州法院的屬人管轄權，以強制仲裁、中止未決仲裁程式，或確認、修改、撤銷或作出判決仲裁員作出的裁決。如果您的索賠金額為一萬美元 ($10,000) 或更少，我們同意您可以選擇是否僅根據提交給仲裁員的檔、通過電話聽證會或親自聽證會進行仲裁，因為由 AAA 規則建立。如果您的索賠超過一萬美元 ($10,000)，聽證會的權利將由 AAA 規則決定。支付 AAA 強加的所有備案、管理和仲裁員費用和開支將受 AAA 規則約束，前提是如果您對 AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企業家族的成員發起仲裁並且所尋求的救濟價值為 10千美元 ($10,000) 或更少，則 AA POKER 將預付所有備案、行政和仲裁費用以及 AAA 徵收的費用（須按以下規定報銷）。如果前一句中的情況適用，但所尋求的救濟價值超過一萬美元 ($10,000)，並且您向仲裁員證明此類成本和開支將比法庭訴訟貴得令人望而卻步，那麼 AA POKER 將支付仲裁員認為必要的任何此類成本和開支的金額，以防止仲裁比法院訴訟昂貴得令人望而卻步（需按以下規定進行報銷）。如果仲裁員根據聯邦民事訴訟規則第 11 條確定您在仲裁中提出的所有索賠都是無意義的，您同意向 AA POKER 償還 AA POKER 支付的所有此類成本和費用，以及您有義務支付的費用根據 AAA 規則。

仲裁協議的例外情況

當事人均同意上法庭解決糾紛1. 與您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企業家族成員的知識產權相關（例如，商標、商業外觀、功能變數名稱、商業秘密、版權或專利）；2. 與任何違反社區規則有關的；或者3.小額法庭管轄範圍內。有關當事方可以向哪個法院解決此類爭議的更多資訊，請參閱第 17 節（不受仲裁約束的法律爭議的地點）。

無集體訴訟

通過自願接受這些條款（在我們的許多服務中，通過自願點擊或點擊遊戲中的按鈕以明確表示您同意這些條款），您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER 公司家族都同意，各方只能帶來以個人為基礎相互索賠。這意味著：1. 雙方同意，您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER Corporate Family 的任何成員均不能作為原告或集體成員在集體訴訟、聯合訴訟或代表訴訟中提出索賠。2. 雙方同意仲裁員不能將一個以上的人的請求合併為一個案件，也不能主持任何合併、集體或代表仲裁程式（除非雙方都同意改變這一點）。3、雙方同意，仲裁員對一人案件的決定或裁決僅影響提出索賠的人，不影響其他AA Poker玩家，不能用於裁決與其他玩家之間的其他糾紛。如果法院裁定"禁止集體訴訟"這一小節不可執行或無效，則整個第 15 節（仲裁協議和集體訴訟豁免）將無效（即消失）。但其餘條款、功能條款和社區規則仍然適用。

選擇退出仲裁協議和集體訴訟豁免

您有權通過客戶支持向我們發送關於您選擇退出的決定的書面通知，選擇退出並且不受本第 15 條中的仲裁和集體訴訟豁免條款的約束。該通知必須在您首次使用服務或可以選擇退出後三十 (30) 天內發送，以較晚者為准；否則，您必須根據本第 15 條規定對爭議進行仲裁。如果您選擇退出這些仲裁條款，AA POKER 也將不受其約束。

對第 15 條仲裁協議和集體訴訟豁免的變更

如果我們更改仲裁和集體訴訟豁免協議的第 15 條，我們將通過電子郵件或通過服務提前 60 天通知您。如果法院或仲裁員裁定關於"仲裁協議第 15 節的變更和集體訴訟豁免"的本小節不可執行或無效，則本小節應從第 15 節中分離出來，法院或仲裁員應適用第一個協議在您開始使用服務後存在的仲裁和集體訴訟豁免部分。

生存

本第 15 條應在這些條款終止後繼續有效。

16. 適用法律

您和AA Poker均同意仲裁

通过自愿接受这些条款（以及在我们的许多服务中，通过自愿点击或点击游戏内按钮以明确表示您同意这些条款），您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER Corporate Family 的任何成员都同意解决任何索赔关于条款、功能条款、社区规则、您与我们的关系或 AA POKER 的服务，通过最终和有约束力的仲裁。这适用于任何法律理论下的所有索赔，除非索赔符合下文确定的仲裁协议例外情况。即使您停止使用您的 AA POKER 帐户或将其删除，此仲裁协议也同样适用。（在本第 15 条和第 17 条中，您、AA POKER 和 AA POKER 公司家族的任何成员可单独称为"一方"或统称为"各方"。）仲裁程序是在中立的仲裁员而不是法官和陪审团之前进行的，因此通过自愿接受这些条款，您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER 公司家族的任何成员都同意放弃在法官和陪审团面前进行审判的权利。仲裁与法庭诉讼有不同的规则。它们不像法庭诉讼那样正式，并且提供有限的机会来迫使另一方分享与争议相关的信息——这一过程称为发现。仲裁员可以在个人基础上判给与法院判给个人相同的损害赔偿和救济。但是，如果任何一方不喜欢仲裁员的决定，法院改变仲裁结果或让仲裁员重新考虑其决定的能力有限。如果任何一方对本仲裁协议是否可以执行或是否适用于争议有不同意见，各方均同意仲裁员也将作出决定。此外，如果您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企业家族成员向法院提起应仲裁的索赔，或任何一方拒绝仲裁应仲裁的索赔，任何其他方都可以请求法院强制当事人去仲裁提交仲裁以解决索赔（即强制仲裁）。在仲裁程序进行期间，您、AA Poker 或 AA POKER 公司家族成员也可以要求法院停止诉讼程序（即中止法院诉讼程序）。

美国仲裁协会（"AAA"）将控制您与 AA POKER 或 AA POKER 公司家族成员之间的任何仲裁，并且将使用 AAA 当时有效的规则和程序，包括消费者相关争议的补充程序。您可以在其网站 www.adr.org 上查看 AAA 的规则和程序。如果这些条款中的某些内容与 AAA 的规则和程序不同，则双方同意遵守这些条款。要启动仲裁程序，请使用 AAA 网站 (www.adr.org) 上的表格。如果您居住在美国境外，仲裁可能会在您提交申请时居住的城市进行。如果您居住在美国，仲裁应在美利坚合众国纽约州启动。您和 AA POKER 进一步同意服从纽约市曼哈顿区任何联邦或州法院的属人管辖权，以强制仲裁、中止未决仲裁程序，或确认、修改、撤销或作出判决仲裁员作出的裁决。如果您的索赔金额为一万美元 ($10,000) 或更少，我们同意您可以选择是否仅根据提交给仲裁员的文件、通过电话听证会或亲自听证会进行仲裁，因为由 AAA 规则建立。如果您的索赔超过一万美元 ($10,000)，听证会的权利将由 AAA 规则决定。支付 AAA 强加的所有备案、管理和仲裁员费用和开支将受 AAA 规则约束，前提是如果您对 AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企业家族的成员发起仲裁并且所寻求的救济价值为 10千美元 ($10,000) 或更少，则 AA POKER 将预付所有备案、行政和仲裁费用以及 AAA 征收的费用（须按以下规定报销）。如果前一句中的情况适用，但所寻求的救济价值超过一万美元 ($10,000)，并且您向仲裁员证明此类成本和开支将比法庭诉讼贵得令人望而却步，那么 AA POKER 将支付仲裁员认为必要的任何此类成本和开支的金额，以防止仲裁比法院诉讼昂贵得令人望而却步（需按以下规定进行报销）。如果仲裁员根据联邦民事诉讼规则第 11 条确定您在仲裁中提出的所有索赔都是无意义的，您同意向 AA POKER 偿还 AA POKER 支付的所有此类成本和费用，以及您有义务支付的费用根据 AAA 规则。

仲裁协议的例外情况

当事人均同意上法庭解决纠纷1. 与您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER 企业家族成员的知识产权相关（例如，商标、商业外观、域名、商业秘密、版权或专利）；2. 与任何违反社区规则有关的；或者3.小额法庭管辖范围内。有关当事方可以向哪个法院解决此类争议的更多信息，请参阅第 17 节（不受仲裁约束的法律争议的地点）。

无集体诉讼

通过自愿接受这些条款（在我们的许多服务中，通过自愿点击或点击游戏中的按钮以明确表示您同意这些条款），您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER 公司家族都同意，各方只能带来以个人为基础相互索赔。这意味着：1. 双方同意，您、AA POKER 或 AA POKER Corporate Family 的任何成员均不能作为原告或集体成员在集体诉讼、联合诉讼或代表诉讼中提出索赔。2. 双方同意仲裁员不能将一个以上的人的请求合并为一个案件，也不能主持任何合并、集体或代表仲裁程序（除非双方都同意改变这一点）。3、双方同意，仲裁员对一人案件的决定或裁决仅影响提出索赔的人，不影响其他AA Poker玩家，不能用于裁决与其他玩家之间的其他纠纷。如果法院裁定"禁止集体诉讼"这一小节不可执行或无效，则整个第 15 节（仲裁协议和集体诉讼豁免）将无效（即消失）。但其余条款、功能条款和社区规则仍然适用。

选择退出仲裁协议和集体诉讼豁免

您有权通过客户支持向我们发送关于您选择退出的决定的书面通知，选择退出并且不受本第 15 条中的仲裁和集体诉讼豁免条款的约束。该通知必须在您首次使用服务或可以选择退出后三十 (30) 天内发送，以较晚者为准；否则，您必须根据本第 15 条规定对争议进行仲裁。如果您选择退出这些仲裁条款，AA POKER 也将不受其约束。

对第 15 条仲裁协议和集体诉讼豁免的变更

如果我们更改仲裁和集体诉讼豁免协议的第 15 条，我们将通过电子邮件或通过服务提前 60 天通知您。如果法院或仲裁员裁定关于"仲裁协议第 15 节的变更和集体诉讼豁免"的本小节不可执行或无效，则本小节应从第 15 节中分离出来，法院或仲裁员应适用第一个协议在您开始使用服务后存在的仲裁和集体诉讼豁免部分。

17. 不受仲裁约束的法律纠纷的审判地

如果您位于美国，则第 15 条中的仲裁协议排除的司法程序（小额索赔诉讼除外）必须在纽约市曼哈顿区的州或联邦法院提起，除非双方同意其他一些位置。您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER 公司家族均同意纽约市曼哈顿区的地点和属人管辖权。如果您位于美国以外的任何地方，则必须在爱尔兰法院提起司法程序，除非双方都同意在其他地点进行。您、AA Poker 和 AA POKER Corporate Family 都同意爱尔兰的地点和属人管辖权。如果您位于澳大利亚并有投诉，那么我们鼓励您首先与我们讨论此事，我们将努力解决此事。如果争议没有以这种方式解决（或无法解决），或者如果我们从监管合规的角度对投诉有任何疑虑，那么我们将采取相应的适当措施。尽管如此，我们保留与 ACMA 或任何其他相关监管机构共享您的信息的权利，以解决投诉或争议，或解决我们可能存在的任何其他问题。

18. 术语分离

这些条款的每一段都是单独运作的。除第 15 条"无集体诉讼"标题下所述外，如果这些条款、功能条款或社区规则的任何部分不可执行，则这些条款、功能条款和社区规则的其余部分仍然适用并具有约束力，任何不可执行的条款将被替换为经济上尽可能接近非法或不可执行条款的条款。

我们不对第三方使用您的信息的方式负责（我们的服务提供商根据我们的指示行事除外）。我们的网站和游戏可能包含来自“第三方服务”（即AA Poker以外的公司）的广告，这些广告可能链接到他们自己的网站、在线服务或移动应用程序。我们不对这些第三方服务的隐私惯例或内容负责。如果您对这些第三方服务如何使用您的信息有任何疑问，您应该查看他们的政策并直接与他们联系。


7. 我们的儿童政策


我们力求确保我们不会收集儿童的信息。一般而言，我们的大多数服务不适用于 13 岁以下的儿童（或位于欧洲国家/地区的 16 岁以下儿童）（统称为“儿童”）。不允许儿童使用这些服务，我们不会故意收集儿童的任何个人信息。虽然我们的服务不以儿童为主要受众，但我们可能会在允许用户继续使用某些服务之前收集年龄信息。对于在此类服务的年龄限制中将自己标识为儿童的用户，如果我们允许儿童使用服务，我们将提供不收集、使用或披露“个人信息”（定义见《儿童在线隐私保护法》（“COPPA”））的服务版本，除非 COPPA 允许，或获得合法有效的父母同意。如果我们得知我们无意中收集了不受儿童 COPPA 例外约束的个人信息，我们将采取合理措施立即从我们的记录中删除该信息。


8. 国际运营和从欧洲国家转移


当您使用我们的服务时，您的个人信息可能会被发送到美国和可能的其他国家。当我们在欧洲国家以外的欧洲国家/地区传输、存储和使用在欧洲国家/地区收集的个人信息时，我们遵守我们的法律义务，并确保您的个人信息受到适当的保障措施或转移到“批准”的地区。重要提示：当您使用我们的服务时，您的个人信息可能会被发送到美国和其他国家/地区。作为我们国际业务的一部分，我们可能会出于合法商业目的不时将个人信息传输给我们的“关联实体”，即与AA Poker共同拥有的任何其他公司实体，或传输给我们的业务合作伙伴和服务提供商。在欧洲国家/地区收集的个人信息可能会转移到并存储在欧洲国家以外的目的地。我们持有的数据也可能由在欧洲国家以外为我们工作的员工、我们的附属实体之一或我们的业务合作伙伴或服务提供商之一进行处理。除其他事项外，这些工作人员可能参与（i）处理交易和您的付款详细信息，或（ii）提供支持服务。当我们在国际上传输您的个人信息时，我们将采取合理措施确保您的个人信息得到安全、合法和我们在此处描述的方式处理。请注意，法律因司法管辖区而异，因此适用于您的信息被转移到或存储、使用或处理的地方的隐私法可能与适用于您居住地的隐私法不同。参与的欧洲国家的居民应就AA Poker处理个人信息或遵守欧盟通用数据保护条例（GDPR）的任何问题、疑虑或投诉直接向AA Poker提出：info@aapoker.app


9. 我们将您的信息保留多长时间


我们将在必要时保留您的信息，以便为您提供服务，维护我们的合法业务运营和/或行使，捍卫或建立我们的权利。我们保留您的个人信息的时间取决于我们收集它的原因以及我们如何使用它，但我们不会保留您的个人信息超过我们的业务目的或法律要求所需的时间。只要您在我们这里拥有活跃的帐户，我们就会保留有关您的个人信息，并与您的帐户和/或您使用的服务相关联。如果您删除帐户，我们将采取合理措施删除这些个人信息。但是，您承认，在您关闭或删除您在我们这里的帐户后，我们可能会在必要时保留一些信息，以使我们能够履行我们的法律义务或行使、捍卫或确立我们的权利。


10. 您的信息安全


我们努力保护您的信息，但您也可以发挥作用。我们实施合理和适当的安全措施，以帮助保护您的在线和离线信息的安全，并确保您的数据得到安全处理并符合本隐私政策。这些措施因信息的敏感性而异。如果您拥有直接在AA Poker注册的帐户，则您的个人资料信息受您用于访问AA Poker帐户的密码的保护。请务必保护和维护您的AA Poker帐户的安全性，并立即告知我们任何未经授权使用您的帐户的情况。如果您忘记了AA Poker帐户的密码，服务允许您请求向您发送说明，说明如何重置密码。如果您通过社交网络访问我们的服务，并且您的社交网络帐户被黑客入侵或以其他方式泄露，这可能会导致有人未经您的许可访问或删除您的AA Poker游戏帐户。因此，请注意确保您的社交网络帐户信息（包括社交网络帐户密码）的安全。我们敦促您在完成使用后注销您的AA Poker帐户以及您用于访问我们服务的任何社交网络帐户。当您登录AA Poker帐户或输入付款信息时，我们和我们的第三方付款处理器使用加密来传输该信息。虽然我们采取预防措施，防止我们的服务以及客户数据库和记录可能的安全漏洞，但没有网站或互联网传输是完全安全的。我们无法保证未经授权的访问、黑客攻击、数据丢失或其他违规行为永远不会发生，也无法保证您的信息在传输到我们的服务时的安全性。任何传播的风险由您自行承担。如果您对我们网站的安全性有疑问，请联系我们。
